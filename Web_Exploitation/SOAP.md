# Slipping on this SOAP

## Personal Rant(Can skip)
Like what the hell is this. I am new to this game and obviously I lack experience,
then comes this challenge... SOAP. Believe my misfortune that I started with this challenge.
All I encountered was failure and headache. Later in the meeting of cryptonite I realised that 
it was one of the harder ones in the first place, moreover involving a topic far harder than just hitting
the inspect button.

## int main(){

We are given a website and a hint that we need to solve this using XXE.
I learnt that XXE stands for XML External Entity and is a type of attack against an application that 
exploits the vulnerability of the website for processing XML data.

As was discussed in the meeting, it requires a piece of code in the request sent to the file 
to crack open the case. But I did watch many youtube videos to study about it, let's 
analyze the code that solves our problem:

```
<>?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]>

<stockCheck><productId>&xxe;</productId></stockCheck>
```

The first line is the introduction required at the start of an XML file. 

The next line defines entity or as we call, a variable with the information containing data 
from the /etc/passwd file.

This information can then be extracted as done in the third line.

Let's proceed.

In burpsuite repeater, we can see the request sent when we push any of the buttons 
we can see the following xxe snippet:

![Pic1]("C:\Users\ElaYTurbo\Desktop\TurboFile\Projects\Crypto\ss6.png")

Let's crack it.

Sliding in the command line, changing the address of the flag file, correcting syntax,

After some minute edits in the command, we get : 

![Pic2](C:\Users\ElaYTurbo\Desktop\TurboFile\Projects\Crypto\ss7.png)

Flag:

**picoCTF{XML_3xtern@l_3nt1t1ty_0dcf926e}**

Even this challenge helped me learn a new topic, Barely made it :relieved:
