# Let's ponder on some forbidden PATHS

## As the title says, we need to mess with the path of the webpage.

It is given that the area we find ourselves in when we click the link is alread in a 
path known as /usr/share/nginx/html/ 

The website blocks out absolute paths, meaning we can't switch our directory right out with /flag.txt

But, the relative paths are open, meaning we can direct ourselves from the directory we are in to the flag.txt file which lies in the root 
directory.

Earlier I did confuse with using the URL to change paths but it didn't work.
But then I realised we could simply use the textbox provided to ponder paths :smiling_face_with_tear:
 .

 /flag.txt doesn't work, access denied.

 So let's use the tricks we learnt in pwn.college tp.

 Using ../../../ as many times as it takes to reach the root and then accessing the 
 flag.txt file.

 So Let's input ../../../../flag.txt
