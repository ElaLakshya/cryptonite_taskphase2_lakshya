# Let's start reverse engineer

I haven't yet even started with the reverse engineering module yet here we are.
But on reviewing, this was much easier to crack with a simple logic.

So we are given an output and an encoder.

```

```
import sys
chars = ""
from fileinput import input
for line in input():
  chars += line

lookup1 = "\n \"#()*+/1:=[]abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
lookup2 = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTabcdefghijklmnopqrst"

out = ""

prev = 0
for char in chars:
  cur = lookup1.index(char)
  out += lookup2[(cur - prev) % 40]
  prev = cur

sys.stdout.write(out)
```

Look at the python files, it's not just simple index finder and add. It uses a 
little complexity by using the index of the previous character to alter the next one and 
hence encrypt it.

it uses 
```
out += lookup2[(cur - prev) % 40]
```

so the reverse of it would be as follows:

the first output character is lookup2[lookup1.index[first character]]. The value of 
prev changes from 0 to index of first char in lookup1. The next character in output
 is lookup2[lookup1.index[second character - prev]]. The value of prev changes from
to cur again. To reverse this...
The first character of input should give lookup1[lookup2.index(first char)], but the 
prev variable here changes to 

```
prev = 0
for char in chars:
	cur = lookup2.index(char)
	j = lookup1[(cur+prev)%40]
	out+=j
	prev=lookup1.index(j)
```

That should reverse the code. After entering ciphertext file into the code, we get

```
#asciiorder
#fortychars
#selfinput
#pythontwo

chars = ""
from fileinput import input
for line in input():
    chars += line
b = 1 / 1

for i in range(len(chars)):
    if i == b * b * b:
        print chars[i] #prints
        b += 1 / 1

```

The code is self input, so if we input the text of the file within itslef, we get

```
a
d
l
i
b
s
```
