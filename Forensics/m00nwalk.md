# Transmitting images over audio

So we are given an audio to download, and a hint how images were transmitted to earth from the moon landing. So making use of that information, we know that the sound probably forms an image containing the flag.

So one application that utilises this technology is qsstv.

Using qsstv we can download the picture we can obtain from the wav file provided.

On searching through some easy ways to navigate around the application, I was able to get the flag in the picture.
