# Flag Leak

This one was a head scratcher ngl. So the hint says format strings. 
What can we infer from this? 

I see from the source code that it is taking input in %s format. Let's try and exploit that.

```
 printf("Tell me a story and then I'll tell you one >> ");
   scanf("%127s", story);
   printf("Here's a story - \n");
   printf(story);
   printf("\n");
 ```

 We can think of giving different format in place of input. Let's try %x.
 ```
 root@TurboMachine:~# nc saturn.picoctf.net 65224
Tell me a story and then I'll tell you one >> %x
Here's a story -
ff914db0
```

There we go, we get an output in the form of a hex file.

That means there is data stored in different parts of the memory, and according to the
source code, so is the flag.

We can print out various memory locations using ```%i$s``` where i stands for any integer.

But putting up various values of i again and again is a tedious task. So i searched for a method to make it easier.
Turns out for loops are everywhere!

In addition to that, we use our knowledge of piping and grep to get it even faster.

The flag took some tries and time to come up in this format.
